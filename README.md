# My Data Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my data portfolio! Below are some of the projects I've developed using Python, SQL, and Streamlit.

## Energy Production & Consumption Analysis (1973â€“2024)
 
This SQL-based project explores the United Statesâ€™ energy trends from 1973 to 2024 using production, consumption, and import datasets. The analysis focuses on fossil fuels, nuclear, and renewable energy, highlighting gaps between production and usage. Key insights include:
* A persistent deficit in fossil fuel energy.
* Growth in renewable energyâ€™s share of total production.
* Use of energy imports to cover production shortfalls.


## ðŸš¦ Chicago Traffic Crashes Dashboard

This project analyzes traffic crash data collected by the Chicago Police Department via its E-Crash reporting system. 
It includes detailed, anonymized records of crashes that occurred on city streets, with variables such as crash time, location, weather, lighting, and roadway conditions. 
While the dataset begins partial coverage in 2015 and becomes citywide by September 2017, it includes both officer-reported and self-reported incidents. 
The dashboard visualizes crash patterns across various dimensions, helping users explore trends and identify potential risk factors across Chicago.
