## ðŸš¦ Chicago Traffic Crashes Dashboard

This project analyzes traffic crash data collected by the Chicago Police Department via its E-Crash reporting system. 
It includes detailed, anonymized records of crashes that occurred on city streets, with variables such as crash time, location, weather, lighting, and roadway conditions. 
While the dataset begins partial coverage in 2015 and becomes citywide by September 2017, it includes both officer-reported and self-reported incidents. 
The dashboard visualizes crash patterns across various dimensions, helping users explore trends and identify potential risk factors across Chicago.
